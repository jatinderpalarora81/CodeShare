Certainly, addressing work-life balance while discussing office meetings between onshore and offshore teams is crucial. Here's how you can communicate this:

Title: Fostering Work-Life Balance in Cross-Continental Collaboration

Introduction:
In today's interconnected world, collaboration across borders and time zones has become essential for our success. As a development manager, I'm committed not only to driving productivity but also to ensuring a healthy work-life balance for our onshore and offshore teams. I'd like to discuss how we manage office meetings to strike that crucial balance.

1. Flexible Meeting Schedules:
One of our top priorities is to accommodate the diverse time zones of our onshore and offshore teams. We recognize that pushing for meetings during inconvenient hours can lead to burnout and negatively impact work-life balance. Therefore, we strive to schedule meetings at times that are reasonable for all team members.

2. Alternate Meeting Locations:
We understand that not every meeting needs to be conducted during traditional office hours. Depending on the nature of the meeting, we are open to holding discussions during off-peak hours or even rotating meeting locations between onshore and offshore teams. This approach ensures that the burden of late or early meetings is shared equitably.

3. Efficient Meeting Practices:
To respect everyone's time, we emphasize the importance of efficient meeting practices. This includes setting clear agendas, sticking to allocated time slots, and ensuring that meetings are as productive as possible. By doing this, we reduce the need for excessive meetings, which can encroach on personal time.

4. Asynchronous Communication:
We encourage teams to embrace asynchronous communication tools, allowing team members to contribute at their own pace. This not only supports work-life balance but also enhances collaboration by accommodating different working hours.

5. Transparency and Feedback:
Open communication is key. We regularly seek feedback from team members regarding meeting schedules and practices. If there are concerns about work-life balance, we address them promptly and find solutions collaboratively.

6. Encouraging Self-Care:
Lastly, we actively promote self-care and the importance of unplugging from work. It's crucial for team members to have downtime to recharge and spend quality time with their families and loved ones.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, achieving a healthy work-life balance in our cross-continental collaboration is a priority for us. We recognize the challenges posed by different time zones and the need to foster a supportive environment
